Adding an Account
=================

Once you have Security Monkey up and running you will need to add an account to monitor. Security Monkey does not 
monitor the account it is running in by default and requires you to add the account through the GUI.

Navigate to https://FQDN:WEB_PORT/#/createaccount

Fill in the required information and create an account.
