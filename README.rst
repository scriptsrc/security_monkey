Security Monkey
***************

Security Monkey monitors policy changes and alerts on insecure configurations in an AWS account. While Security Monkeyâ€™s main purpose is security, it also proves a useful tool for tracking down potential problems as it is essentially a change tracking system.

It works on CPython 2.7. It is known
to work on Ubuntu Linux and OS X.
